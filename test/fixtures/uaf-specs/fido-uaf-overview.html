      <p>The FIDO UAF strong authentication framework enables online
	services and websites, whether on the open Internet or within
	enterprises, to transparently leverage native security features
	of end-user computing devices for strong user authentication and
	to reduce the problems associated with creating and remembering
	many online credentials. The FIDO UAF Reference Architecture
	describes the components, protocols, and interfaces that make
	up the FIDO UAF strong authentication ecosystem.

      </p>

      <section class="informative">
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>The FIDO Alliance mission is to change the nature of online
	  strong authentication by:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Developing technical specifications defining open, scalable,
	  interoperable mechanisms that supplant reliance on passwords to
	  securely authenticate users of online services.
	</li>
	<li>Operating industry programs to help ensure successful worldwide
	  adoption of the specifications.
	</li>
	<li>Submitting mature technical specifications to recognized
	  standards development organization(s) for formal
	  standardization.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The core ideas driving the FIDO Alliance's efforts are 1) ease
	  of use, 2) privacy and security, and 3) standardization. The
	  primary objective is to enable online services and websites,
	  whether on the open Internet or within enterprises, to leverage
	  native security features of end-user computing devices for
	  strong user authentication and to reduce the problems
	  associated with creating and remembering many online
	  credentials.
	</p>
	<p>There are two key protocols included in the FIDO architecture
	  that cater to two basic options for user experience when
	  dealing with Internet services. The two protocols share many of
	  underpinnings but are tuned to the specific intended use cases.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) Protocol
	</strong></p>
	<p>The UAF protocol allows online services to offer password-less
	  and multi-factor security. The user registers their device to
	  the online service by selecting a local authentication
	  mechanism such as swiping a finger, looking at the camera,
	  speaking into the mic, entering a PIN, etc. The UAF protocol
	  allows the service to select which mechanisms are presented to
	  the user.
	</p>
	<p>Once registered, the user simply repeats the local
	  authentication action whenever they need to authenticate to the
	  service. The user no longer needs to enter their password when
	  authenticating from that device. UAF also allows experiences
	  that combine multiple authentication mechanisms such as
	  fingerprint + PIN.
	</p>
	<p>This document that you are reading describes the UAF reference
	  architecture.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Protocol
    </strong></p>
	  <p>The U2F protocol allows online services to augment the security
	  of their existing password infrastructure by adding a strong
	  second factor to user login. The user logs in with a username
	  and password as before. The service can also prompt the user to
	  present a second factor device at any time it chooses. The
	  strong second factor allows the service to simplify its
	  passwords (e.g. 4-digit PIN) without compromising security.
	</p>
	<p>During registration and authentication, the user presents the
	  second factor by simply pressing a button on a USB device or
	  tapping over NFC. The user can use their FIDO U2F device across
	  all online services that support the protocol leveraging
	  built-in support in web browsers.
	</p>
	<p>Please refer to the FIDO website for an overview and
	  documentation set focused on the U2F protocol.

	<h2>FIDO UAF Goals</h2>
	<p>In order to address today's strong authentication issues and
	  develop a smoothly-functioning low-friction ecosystem, a
	  comprehensive, open, multi-vendor solution architecture is
	  needed that encompasses:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li>User devices, whether personally acquired, enterprise-issued, or
	  enterprise BYOD, and the device's potential operating
	  environment, e.g. home, office, in the field, etc.
	</li>
	<li>Authenticators<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
	</li>
	<li>Relying party applications and their deployment environments
	</li>
	<li>Meeting the needs of both end users and Relying Parties
	</li>
	<li>Strong focus on both browser- and native-app-based end-user
	  experience
	</li>
    </ul>
	<p>This solution architecture must feature:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li>FIDO UAF Authenticator discovery, attestation, and provisioning
	</li>
	<li>Cross-platform strong authentication protocols leveraging FIDO
	  UAF Authenticators
	</li>
	<li>A uniform cross-platform authenticator API
	</li>
	<li>Simple mechanisms for Relying Party integration
	</li>
    </ul>
	<p>The FIDO Alliance envisions an open, multi-vendor,
	  cross-platform reference architecture with these goals:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li><strong>Support strong, multi-factor authentication</strong>: Protect Relying
	  Parties against unauthorized access by supporting end user
	  authentication using two or more strong authentication factors
	  ("something you know", "something you have", "something you
	  are").
	</li>
	<li><strong>Build on, but not require, existing device capabilities</strong>:
	  Facilitate user authentication using built-in platform
	  authenticators or capabilities (fingerprint sensors, cameras,
	  microphones, embedded TPM hardware), but do not preclude the
	  use of discrete additional authenticators.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Enable selection of the authentication mechanism</strong>: Facilitate
	  Relying Party and user choice amongst supported authentication
	  mechanisms in order to mitigate risks for their particular use
	  cases.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Simplify integration of new authentication capabilities</strong>: Enable
	  organizations to expand their use of strong authentication to
	  address new use cases, leverage new device's capabilities, and
	  address new risks with a single authentication approach.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Incorporate extensibility for future refinements and
	  innovations</strong>: Design extensible protocols and APIs in order to
	  support the future emergence of additional types of
	  authenticators, authentication methods, and authentication
	  protocols, while maintaining reasonable backwards
	  compatibility.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Leverage existing open standards where possible, openly innovate
	  and extend where not</strong>: An open, standardized, royalty-free
	  specification suite will enable the establishment of a
	  virtuous-circle ecosystem, and decrease the risk, complexity,
	  and costs associated with deploying strong authentication.
	  Existing gaps -- notably uniform authenticator provisioning and
	  attestation, a uniform cross-platform authenticator API, as
	  well as a flexible strong authentication challenge-response
	  protocol leveraging the user's authenticators will be
	  addressed.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Complement existing single sign-on, federation initiatives</strong>:
	  While industry initiatives (such as OpenID, OAuth, SAML, and
	  others) have created mechanisms to reduce the reliance on
	  passwords through single sign-on or federation technologies,
	  they do not directly address the need for an initial strong
	  authentication interaction between end users and Relying
	  Parties.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Preserve the privacy of the end user</strong>: Provide the user control
	  over the sharing of device capability information with Relying
	  Parties, and mitigate the potential for collusion amongst
	  Relying Parties.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Unify end-User Experience</strong>: Create easy, fun, and unified
	  end-user experiences across all platforms and across similar
	  Authenticators.
	</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>FIDO UAF High-Level Architecture</h2>
      <p>The FIDO UAF Architecture is designed to meet the FIDO
	goals and yield the desired ecosystem benefits. It accomplishes
	this by filling in the status-quo's gaps using standardized
	protocols and APIs.
      </p>
      <p>The following diagram summarizes the reference architecture and
	how its components relate to typical user devices and Relying
	Parties.

      <section>
	<h3>FIDO UAF Client
	</h3>
	<p>A FIDO UAF Client implements the client side of the FIDO UAF
	  protocols, and is responsible for:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Interacting with specific FIDO UAF Authenticators using the FIDO
	  UAF Authenticator Abstraction layer via the FIDO UAF
	  Authenticator API.
	</li>
	<li>Interacting with a user agent on the device (e.g. a mobile app,
	  browser) using user agent-specific interfaces to communicate
	  with the FIDO UAF Server. For example, a FIDO-specific browser
	  plugin would use existing browser plugin interfaces or a mobile
	  app may use a FIDO-specific SDK. The user agent is then
	  responsible for communicating FIDO UAF messages to a FIDO UAF
	  Server at a Relying Party.
	</li>
    </ul>
	<p>The FIDO UAF architecture ensures that FIDO client software can
	  be implemented across a range of system types, operating
	  systems, and Web browsers. While FIDO client software is
	  typically platform-specific, the interactions between the
	  components should ensure a consistent user experience from
	  platform to platform.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>FIDO UAF Server
	</h3>
	<p>A FIDO UAF server implements the server side of the FIDO UAF
	  protocols and is responsible for:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Interacting with the Relying Party web server to communicate
	  FIDO UAF protocol messages to a FIDO UAF Client via a device
	  user agent.
	</li>
	<li>Validating FIDO UAF authenticator attestations against the
	  configured authenticator metadata to ensure only trusted
	  authenticators are registered for use.
	</li>
	<li>Manage the association of registered FIDO UAF Authenticators to
	  user accounts at the Relying Party.
	</li>
	<li>Evaluating user authentication and transaction confirmation
	  responses to determine their validity.
	</li>
    </ul>
	<p>The FIDO UAF server is conceived as being deployable as an
	  on-premise server by Relying Parties or as being outsourced to
	  a FIDO-enabled third-party service provider.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>FIDO UAF Protocols
	</h3>
	<p>The FIDO UAF protocols carry FIDO UAF messages between user
	  devices and Relying Parties. There are protocol messages
	  addressing:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Authenticator Registration: The FIDO UAF registration protocol
	  enables Relying Parties to:
	</li>
    <ul>
	<li>Discover the FIDO UAF Authenticators available on a user's
	  system or device. Discovery will convey FIDO UAF Authenticator
	  attributes to the Relying Party thus enabling policy decisions
	  and enforcement to take place.
	</li>
	<li>Verify attestation assertions made by the FIDO UAF
	  Authenticators to ensure the authenticator is authentic and
	  trusted. Verification occurs using the attestation public key
	  certificates distributed via authenticator metadata.
	</li>
	<li>Register the authenticator and associate it with the user's
	  account at the Relying Party. Once an authenticator attestation
	  has been validated, the Relying Party can provide a unique
	  secure identifier that is specific to the Relying Party and the
	  FIDO UAF Authenticator. This identifier can be used in future
	  interactions between the pair {RP, Authenticator} and is not
	  known to any other devices.
	</li>
    </ul>
	<li>User Authentication: Authentication is typically based on
	  cryptographic challenge-response authentication protocols and
	  will facilitate user choice regarding which FIDO UAF
	  Authenticators are employed in an authentication event.
	</li>
	<li>Secure Transaction Confirmation: If the user authenticator
	  includes the capability to do so, a Relying Party can present
	  the user with a secure message for confirmation. The message
	  content is determined by the Relying Party and could be used in
	  a variety of contexts such as confirming a financial
	  transaction, a user agreement ,or releasing patient records.
	</li>
	<li>Authenticator Deregistration: Deregistration is typically required when the 
	  user account is removed  at the Relying Party. The Relying Party can trigger the 
	  deregistration by requesting the Authenticator to delete the associated UAF 
	  credential with the user account.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>FIDO UAF Authenticator Abstraction Layer</h3>
	<p>The FIDO UAF Authenticator Abstraction Layer provides a uniform
	  API to FIDO Clients enabling the use of authenticator-based
	  cryptographic services for FIDO-supported operations. It
	  provides a uniform lower-layer "authenticator plugin" API
	  facilitating the deployment of multi-vendor FIDO UAF
	  Authenticators and their requisite drivers.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>FIDO UAF Authenticator</h3>
	<p>A FIDO UAF Authenticator is a secure entity, connected to or
	  housed within FIDO user devices, that can create key material
	  associated to a Relying Party. The key can then be used to
	  participate in FIDO UAF strong authentication protocols. For
	  example, the FIDO UAF Authenticator can provide a response to a
	  cryptographic challenge using the key material thus
	  authenticating itself to the Relying Party.
	</p>
	<p>In order to meet the goal of simplifying integration of trusted
	  authentication capabilities, a FIDO UAF Authenticator will be
	  able to attest to its particular type (e.g., biometric) and
	  capabilities (e.g., supported crypto algorithms), as well as to
	  its provenance. This provides a Relying Party with a high degree
	  of confidence that the user being authenticated is indeed the
	  user that originally registered with the site.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>FIDO UAF Authenticator Metadata Validation
	</h3>
	<p>In the FIDO UAF context, attestation is how Authenticators make
	  claims to a Relying Party during registration that the keys
	  they generate, and/or certain measurements they report,
	  originate from genuine devices with certified characteristics.
	  An attestation signature, carried in a FIDO UAF registration
	  protocol message is validated by the FIDO UAF Server. FIDO UAF
	  Authenticators are created with attestation private keys used
	  to create the signatures and the FIDO UAF Server validates the
	  signature using that authenticator's attestation public key
	  certificate located in the authenticator metadata. The metadata
	  holding attestation certificates is shared with FIDO UAF Servers
	  out of band.

      <h2>FIDO UAF Usage Scenarios and Protocol Message Flows</h2>
      <p>The FIDO UAF ecosystem supports the use cases briefly described
	in this section.
      </p>
      <section>
      <h3>FIDO UAF Authenticator Acquisition and User Enrollment</h3>
      <p>It is expected that users will acquire FIDO UAF Authenticators
	in various ways: they purchase a new system that comes with
	embedded FIDO UAF Authenticator capability; they purchase a
	device with an embedded FIDO UAF Authenticator, or they are
	given a FIDO Authenticator by their employer or some other
	institution such as their bank.
      </p>
      <p>After receiving a FIDO UAF Authenticator, the user must go
	through an authenticator-specific enrollment process, which is
	outside the scope of the FIDO UAF protocols. For example, in
	the case of a fingerprint sensing authenticator, the user must
	register their fingerprint(s) with the authenticator. Once
	enrollment is complete, the FIDO UAF Authenticator is ready for
	registration with FIDO UAF enabled online services and websites.

      <h3>Authenticator Registration</h3>
      <p>Given the FIDO UAF architecture, a Relying Party is able to
	transparently detect when a user begins interacting with them
	while possessing an initialized FIDO UAF Authenticator. In this
	initial introduction phase, the website will prompt the user
	regarding any detected FIDO UAF Authenticator(s), giving the
	user options regarding registering it with the website or not.

      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>Following registration, the FIDO UAF Authenticator will be
	subsequently employed whenever the user authenticates with the
	website (and the authenticator is present). The website can
	implement various fallback strategies for those occasions when
	the FIDO Authenticator is not present. These might range from
	allowing conventional login with diminished privileges to
	disallowing login.
      </p>

	<figcaption>Authentication Message Flow
	</figcaption>
      </figure>
	<p>This overall scenario will vary slightly depending upon the type
	  of FIDO UAF Authenticator being employed. Some authenticators
	  may sample biometric data such as a face image, fingerprint, or
	  voice print. Others will require a PIN or local
	  authenticator-specific passphrase entry. Still others may
	  simply be a hardware bearer authenticator. Note that it is
	  permissible for a FIDO Client to interact with external
	  services as part of the authentication of the user to the
	  authenticator as long as the FIDO Privacy Principles are
	  adhered to.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>Step-up Authentication</h3>
	<p>Step-up authentication is an embellishment to the basic website
	  login use case. Often, online services and websites allow
	  unauthenticated, and/or only nominally authenticated use -- for
	  informational browsing, for example. However, once users
	  request more valuable interactions, such as entering a
	  members-only area, the website may request further
	  higher-assurance authentication. This could proceed in several
	  steps if the user then wishes to purchase
	  something, with higher-assurance steps with increasing
	  transaction value.
	</p>
	<p>FIDO UAF will smoothly facilitate this interaction style since
	  the website will be able to discover which FIDO UAF
	  Authenticators are available on FIDO-wielding users' systems,
	  and select incorporation of the appropriate one(s) in any particular authentication interaction. Thus
	  online services and websites will be able to dynamically tailor
	  initial, as well as step-up authentication interactions
	  according to what the user is able to wield and the needed
	  inputs to website's risk analysis engine given the interaction
	  the user has requested.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<h3>Transaction Confirmation</h3>
	<p>There are various innovative use cases possible given FIDO
	  UAF-enabled Relying Parties with end-users wielding FIDO UAF
	  Authenticators. Website login and step-up authentication are
	  relatively simple examples. A somewhat more advanced use case
	  is secure transaction processing.
	</p>

	  <img src="./img/fido-uaf-overview-transact-flow.png"

	       alt="Transaction Confirmation Message Flow"/>
	  <figcaption>Confirmation Message Flow</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Imagine a situation in which a Relying Party wants the end-user
	  to confirm a transaction (e.g. financial operation, privileged
	  operation, etc) so that any tampering of a transaction message
	  during its route to the end device display and back can be
	  detected. FIDO architecture has a concept of "secure
	  transaction" which provides this capability. Basically if a
	  FIDO UAF Authenticator has a transaction confirmation display capability, FIDO
	  UAF architecture makes sure that the system supports What You
	  See is What You Sign mode (WYSIWYS). A number of different use
	  cases can derive from this capability -- mainly related to
	  authorization of transactions (send money, perform a context
	  specific privileged action, confirmation of email/address,
	  etc).

     <section>
      <h3>Authenticator Deregistration</h3>
      <p> There are some situations where a Relying Party may need to remove 
	the UAF credentials associated with a specific user account in 
	FIDO Authenticator. For example, the user’s account is cancelled or deleted, 
	the user’s FIDO Authenticator is lost or stolen, etc.  In these situations, 
	the RP may request the FIDO Authenticator to delete authentication keys 
	that are bound to user account.

	<h3>Adoption of New Types of FIDO UAF Authenticators</h3>
	<p>Authenticators will evolve and new types are expected to appear
	  in the future. Their adoption on the part of both users and
	  Relying Parties is facilitated by the FIDO architecture. In
	  order to support a new FIDO UAF Authenticator type, Relying
	  Parties need only to add a new entry to their configuration
	  describing the new authenticator, along with its FIDO
	  Attestation Certificate. Afterwards, end users will be able to
	  use the new FIDO UAF Authenticator type with those Relying
	  Parties.

        <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
        
      <p> User privacy is fundamental to FIDO and is supported in UAF 
      by design. Some of the key privacy-aware design elements are summarized here:
      
      <ul>
          <li>A UAF device does not have a global identifier visible across 
          relying parties and does not have a global identifier within a 
          particular relying party. If for example, a person looses their 
          UAF device, someone finding it cannot “point it at a relying party” and 
          discover if the original user had any accounts with that relying party. 
          Similarly, if two users share a UAF 
          device and each has registered their account with the same relying 
          party with this device, the relying party will not be able 
          to discern that the two accounts share a device, based on the UAF 
          protocol alone.</li>
          
          <li>The UAF protocol generates unique asymmetric cryptographic key pairs
          on a per-device, per-user 
          account, and per-relying party basis. Cryptographic keys used with different 
          relying parties will not allow any one party to link all the actions 
          to the same user, hence the unlinkability property of UAF.</li>
          
          <li>The UAF protocol operations require minimal personal data collection:
          at most they incorporate a user's relying party username. This personal data 
          is only used for FIDO purposes, for 
          example to perform user registration, user verification, or authorization.
          This personal data does not leave the 
          user’s computing environment and is only persisted locally when necessary.</li>
          
          <li>In UAF, user verification is performed locally. The UAF protocol 
          does not convey biometric data to relying 
          parties, nor does it require the storage of such data 
          at relying parties.</li>
          
          <li>Users explicitly approve the use of a UAF device 
          with a specific relying party. Unique cryptographic keys are generated 
          and bound to a relying party during registration only after the user’s 
          consent.</li>
          
          <li>UAF authenticators can only be identified by their attestation 
          certificates on a production batch-level or on manufacturer- and 
          device model-level. They cannot be identified individually. The 
          UAF specifications require implementers to ship UAF authenticators 
          with the same attestation certificate and private key in batches of 
          100,000 or more in order to provide unlinkability.</li>
          
      </ul>

        <h2>Relationship to Other Technologies</h2>
        <h3>OpenID, SAML, and OAuth</h3>
	<p>FIDO protocols (both UAF and U2F) complement Federated Identity
	  Management (FIM) frameworks, such as OpenID and SAML, as well
	  as web authorization protocols, such as OAuth. FIM Relying
	  Parties can leverage an initial authentication event at an
	  identity provider (IdP). However, OpenID and SAML do not define
	  specific mechanisms for direct user authentication at the IdP.
	</p>
	<p>When an IdP is integrated with a FIDO-enabled authentication
	  service, it can subsequently leverage the attributes of the
	  strong authentication with its Relying Parties. The following
	  diagram illustrates this relationship. FIDO-based
	  authentication (1) would logically occur first, and the FIM
	  protocols would then leverage that authentication event into
	  single sign-on events between the identity provider and its
	  federated Relying Parties (2).<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

	<h3>OATH, TCG, PKCS#11, and ISO 24727
	</h3>
	<p>These are either initiatives (OATH, Trusted Computing Group
	  (TCG)), or industry standards (PKCS#11, ISO 24727). They all
	  share an underlying focus on hardware authenticators.
	</p>
	<p>PKCS#11 and ISO 24727 define smart-card-based authenticator
	  abstractions.
	</p>
	<p>TCG produces specifications for the Trusted Platform Module, as
	  well as networked trusted computing.
	</p>
	<p>OATH, the "Initiative for Open AuTHentication", focuses on
	  defining symmetric key provisioning protocols and
	  authentication algorithms for hardware One-Time Password (OTP)
	  authenticators.
	</p>
	<p>The FIDO framework shares several core notions with the
	  foregoing efforts, such as an authentication abstraction
	  interface, authenticator attestation, key provisioning, and
	  authentication algorithms. FIDO's work will leverage and extend
	  some of these specifications.
	</p>
	<p>Specifically, FIDO will complement them by addressing:
	</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Authenticator discovery
	</li>
	<li>User experience
	</li>
	<li>Harmonization of various authenticator types, such as biometric,
	  OTP, simple presence, smart card, TPM, etc.
