    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document defines the registry of UAF-specific constants that are used and 
      referenced in various UAF specifications.
      It is expected that, over time, new constants will be added to this registry. For 
      example new authentication algorithms and
      new types of authenticator characteristics will require new constants to be defined 
      for use within the specifications.</p>
    <p>FIDO-specific constants that are common to multiple protocol families are defined in [[!FIDORegistry]].

          <dd>This assertion scheme allows the authenticator and the FIDO Server 
	    to exchange an asymmetric authentication key generated by the authenticator. 
	    The authenticator MUST generate a key pair (UAuth.pub/UAuth.priv) to be 
	    used with algorithm suites listed in [[!FIDORegistry]] section "Authentication Algorithms" (with prefix
            <code>ALG_</code>). This assertion scheme is using a compact 
	    Tag Length Value (TLV) encoding for the KRD and SignData messages generated 
	    by the authenticators. This is the default assertion scheme for the UAF protocol.</dd>

    <h2>Predefined Tags</h2>
    <p>The internal structure of UAF authenticator commands is a “Tag-Length-Value” (TLV) 
      sequence. The tag is a 2-byte unique unsigned value describing the type of field 
      the data represents, the length is a 2-byte unsigned value indicating the size 
      of the value in bytes, and the value is the variable-sized series of bytes which 
      contain data for this item in the sequence.</p>
    <p>Although 2 bytes are allotted for the tag, only the first 14 bits 
      (values up to 0x3FFF) should be used to accommodate the limitations 
      of some hardware platforms.</p>
    <p>A tag that has the 14th bit (0x2000) set indicates that it is critical 
      and a receiver must abort processing the entire message if it cannot process that tag.</p>
    <p>A tag that has the 13th bit (0x1000) set indicates a composite tag that 
      can be parsed by recursive descent.</p>

	  <p>
	    If the ASM supports this extension it must call the SafetyNet API

	    to the UAF Response object (according to sections 
	    3.4.6.4. and 3.5.7.4 step 4 in [[UAFProtocol]]).
