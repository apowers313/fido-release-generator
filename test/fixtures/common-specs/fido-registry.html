    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document defines the registry of FIDO-specific constants common 
      to multiple FIDO protocol families.
      It is expected that, over time, new constants will be added to this registry. For 
      example new authentication algorithms and
      new types of authenticator characteristics will require new constants to be defined 
      for use within the specifications.</p>

    <h2>Authenticator Characteristics</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>User Verification Methods</h3>
      <p>The <code>USER_VERIFY</code> constants are flags in a bitfield represented 
	as a 32 bit long integer. They describe
	the methods and capabilities of an UAF authenticator for <i>locally</i> verifying 
	a user. The operational details of
	these methods are opaque to the server. These constants are used in the 
	authoritative metadata for an authenticator,
	reported and queried through the UAF Discovery APIs, and used to form authenticator 
	policies in UAF protocol messages.</p>
      <p>All user verification methods must be performed locally by the authenticator 
	in order to meet FIDO privacy principles. </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE</code> <code>0x00000001</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator is able to confirm user presence 
	  in any fashion. If this flag and no
	  other is set for user verification, the guarantee is only that the authenticator 
	  cannot be operated without some human
	  intervention, not necessarily that the presence verification provides any level 
	  of authentication of the human's identity.
	  (e.g. a device that requires a touch to activate)</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_FINGERPRINT</code> <code>0x00000002</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses any type of measurement of 
	  a fingerprint for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_PASSCODE</code> <code>0x00000004</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses a local-only passcode 
	  (i.e. a passcode not known by the server) for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_VOICEPRINT</code> <code>0x00000008</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses a voiceprint (also known as speaker recognition) 
	  for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_FACEPRINT</code> <code>0x00000010</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses any manner of face recognition 
	  to verify the user.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_LOCATION</code> <code>0x00000020</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses any form of location sensor 
	  or measurement for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_EYEPRINT</code> <code>0x00000040</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses any form of eye biometrics 
	  for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_PATTERN</code> <code>0x00000080</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses a drawn pattern for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_HANDPRINT</code> <code>0x00000100</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses any measurement of a full 
	  hand (including palm-print, hand geometry or vein geometry) for user verification.</dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_NONE</code> <code>0x00000200</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator will respond without any 
	  user interaction (e.g. Silent Authenticator).
        </dd>
        <dt><code>USER_VERIFY_ALL</code> <code>0x00000400</code></dt>
        <dd>If an authenticator sets multiple flags for user verification types, it MAY 
	  also set this flag to indicate that all verification methods will be enforced 
	  (e.g. faceprint AND voiceprint). If flags for multiple
          user verification methods are set and this flag is not set, verification with 
	  only one is necessary (e.g. fingerprint OR passcode).</dd>

      <h3>Key Protection Types</h3>
      <p>The <code>KEY_PROTECTION</code> constants are flags in a bit field 
	represented as a 16 bit long integer.  They describe the method an 
	authenticator uses to protect the private key material for FIDO registrations.
	Refer to [[UAFAuthnrCommands]] for more details on the relevance of keys and 
	key protection.  These constants are used in the authoritative metadata for an 
	authenticator, reported and queried through the UAF Discovery APIs, and used to 
	form authenticator policies in UAF protocol messages. </p>
      <p>When used in metadata describing an authenticator, several of these flags are <em>exclusive</em> of 
	others (i.e. can not be combined) - the certified metadata may have
	at most one of the mutually exclusive bits set to 1. When used in authenticator 
	policy, any bit may be set to 1, e.g. to indicate that a server is 
	willing to accept authenticators using either <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code> or
	<code>KEY_PROTECTION_HARDWARE</code>.</p>
      <p class="note">These flags must be set according to the <i>effective</i> security of the 
	keys, in order to follow the assumptions made in [[FIDOSecRef]].  For example, if a key
	is stored in a secure element <i>but</i> software running on the FIDO User Device 
	could call a function in the secure element to export the key either in the clear or using 
	an arbitrary wrapping key, then the effective security is <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code> and 
	not <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SECURE_ELEMENT</code>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>KEY_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code> <code>0x0001</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator uses software-based key management. 
	  Exclusive in authenticator metadata with
          <code>KEY_PROTECTION_HARDWARE</code>, <code>KEY_PROTECTION_TEE</code>, 
	  <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SECURE_ELEMENT</code>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>KEY_PROTECTION_HARDWARE</code> <code>0x0002</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag SHOULD be set if the authenticator uses hardware-based key management. 
	  Exclusive in authenticator metadata with
          <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>KEY_PROTECTION_TEE</code> <code>0x0004</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag SHOULD be set if the authenticator uses the Trusted Execution 
	  Environment [[TEE]] for key management. In authenticator metadata,
	  this flag should be set in conjunction with <code>KEY_PROTECTION_HARDWARE</code>. 
	  Mutually exclusive in authenticator metadata with
          <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code>, <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SECURE_ELEMENT</code>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>KEY_PROTECTION_SECURE_ELEMENT</code> <code>0x0008</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag SHOULD be set if the authenticator uses a 
	  Secure Element [[SecureElement]] for key management. In authenticator metadata,
	  this flag should be set in conjunction with <code>KEY_PROTECTION_HARDWARE</code>. 
	  Mutually exclusive in authenticator metadata with
	  <code>KEY_PROTECTION_TEE</code>, <code>KEY_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>KEY_PROTECTION_REMOTE_HANDLE</code> <code>0x0010</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator does not store (wrapped) UAuth keys 
	  at the client, but relies on a server-provided key handle.
	  This flag MUST be set in conjunction with one of the other <code>KEY_PROTECTION</code> 
	  flags to indicate how the local key handle wrapping key and operations are protected. 
	  Servers MAY unset this flag in authenticator policy if they are not prepared to store and return
	  key handles, for example, if they have a requirement to respond 
	  indistinguishably to authentication attempts against userIDs that do and
	  do not exist. Refer to [[UAFProtocol]] for more details.</dd>    
      </dl>

    <section>
      <h3>Matcher Protection Types</h3>
      <p>The <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION</code> constants are flags in a bit field 
	represented as a 16 bit long integer.
	They describe the method an authenticator uses to protect the matcher 
	that performs user verification. 
	These constants are used in the authoritative metadata for an authenticator, 
	reported and queried through 
	the UAF Discovery APIs, and used to form authenticator policies in 
	UAF protocol messages.  Refer to [[UAFAuthnrCommands]]
	for more details on the matcher component.</p>
      <p class="note">These flags must be set according to the <i>effective</i> security of the 
	matcher, in order to follow the assumptions made in [[FIDOSecRef]].  For example, if a passcode based
	matcher is implemented in a secure element, but the passcode is expected to be 
	provided as unauthenticated parameter, then the effective security 
	is <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code> and 
	not <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_ON_CHIP</code>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code> <code>0x0001</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MUST be set if the authenticator's matcher is running in software. 
	  Exclusive in authenticator metadata with
          <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_TEE</code>,
          <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_ON_CHIP</code>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_TEE</code> <code>0x0002</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag SHOULD be set if the authenticator's matcher is running inside 
	  the Trusted Execution Environment [[TEE]]. Mutually exclusive in authenticator metadata with
          <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code>,
          <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_ON_CHIP</code>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_ON_CHIP</code> <code>0x0004</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag SHOULD be set if the authenticator's matcher is running on the chip. 
	  Mutually exclusive in authenticator metadata with <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_TEE</code>,
          <code>MATCHER_PROTECTION_SOFTWARE</code>
        </dd>

    <section>
      <h3>Authenticator Attachment Hints</h3>
      <p>The <code>ATTACHMENT_HINT</code> constants are flags in a bit field 
	represented as a 32 bit long. They describe the method an
	authenticator uses to communicate with the FIDO User Device. These constants are reported and
	queried through the UAF Discovery APIs [[UAFAppAPIAndTransport]], and used to form Authenticator 
	policies in UAF protocol messages. Because the connection
	state and topology of an authenticator may be transient, these values are 
	only hints that can be used by server-supplied policy
	to guide the user experience, e.g. to prefer a device that is connected and 
	ready for authenticating or confirming a low-value transaction,
	rather than one that is more secure but requires more user effort.</p> 
      <p class="note">These flags are not a mandatory part of authenticator metadata and,
	when present, only indicate possible states that may be reported during 
	authenticator discovery.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_INTERNAL</code> <code>0x0001</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that the authenticator is permanently attached 
	  to the FIDO User Device.
          <p>A device such as a smartphone may have authenticator functionality 
	    that is able to be used both locally and remotely.
	    In such a case, the FIDO client MUST filter and exclusively 
	    report only the relevant bit during Discovery and when performing policy matching.</p>
          <p>This flag cannot be combined with any other <code>ATTACHMENT_HINT</code> flags.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_EXTERNAL</code> <code>0x0002</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate, for a hardware-based authenticator, that 
	  it is removable or remote from the FIDO User Device. 
	  <p>A device such as a smartphone may have 
	    authenticator functionality that is able to be used
	    both locally and remotely. In such a case, the FIDO UAF Client MUST filter and 
	    exclusively report only the relevant bit during
	    discovery and when performing policy matching.</p>
	</dd>
	
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_WIRED</code> <code>0x0004</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that an external authenticator currently has an exclusive 
	  wired connection, e.g. through USB, Firewire
	  or similar, to the FIDO User Device.</dd>
	
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_WIRELESS</code> <code>0x0008</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that an external authenticator communicates with the FIDO User Device
	  through a personal area or otherwise non-routed wireless protocol, such as Bluetooth or NFC.</dd>
	
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_NFC</code> <code>0x0010</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that an external authenticator is able to communicate by NFC 
	  to the FIDO User Device. As part of
	  authenticator metadata, or when reporting characteristics through discovery, if this flag is set, the
          <code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_WIRELESS</code> flag SHOULD also be set as well.</dd>
	
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_BLUETOOTH</code> <code>0x0020</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that an external authenticator is able to communicate using 
	  Bluetooth with the FIDO User Device.
	  As part of authenticator metadata, or when reporting characteristics through 
	  discovery, if this flag is set, the
          <code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_WIRELESS</code> flag SHOULD also be set.</dd>
	
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_NETWORK</code> <code>0x0040</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that the authenticator is connected to the FIDO User Device
	  ver a non-exclusive network (e.g. over a TCP/IP LAN or WAN, as opposed 
	  to a PAN or point-to-point connection).</dd>
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_READY</code> <code>0x0080</code></dt>
        <dd>Thif flag MAY be set to indicate that an external authenticator is in a "ready" state. This flag 
	  is set by the ASM at its discretion.
	  <p class="note">Generally this should indicate that the device is immediately available to 
	    perform user verification without additional
	    actions such as connecting the device or creating a new biometric 
	    profile enrollment, but the exact meaning may vary for
	    different types of devices. For example, a USB authenticator may only 
	    report itself as ready when it is plugged in,
	    or a Bluetooth authenticator when it is paired and connected, but an 
	    NFC-based authenticator may always report itself as ready.</p>
	</dd>
	
        <dt><code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_WIFI_DIRECT</code> <code>0x0100</code></dt>
        <dd>This flag MAY be set to indicate that an external authenticator is able to communicate using 
	  WiFi Direct with the FIDO User Device.
	  As part of authenticator metadata and when reporting characteristics 
	  through discovery, if this flag is set, the
          <code>ATTACHMENT_HINT_WIRELESS</code> flag SHOULD also be set.</dd>

      Other <code>TRANSACTION_CONFIRMATION_DISPLAY</code>  flags MAY also be set if this flag is set. 
      If the authenticator does not support a transaction confirmation display, then the value of
