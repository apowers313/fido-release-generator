      <p>This document is the FIDO Alliance glossary of normative technical terms.</p>
      
      <p>This document is not an exhaustive compendium of all FIDO technical terminology because the 
	FIDO terminology is built upon existing terminology. Thus many terms that are commonly used 
	within this context are not listed. They may be found in the glossaries/documents/specifications 
	referenced in the bibliography. Terms defined here that are not attributed to other 
	glossaries/documents/specifications are being defined here.</p>
      <p>This glossary is expected to evolve along with the FIDO Alliance specifications and documents.</p>

	<dd><p>See FIDO Authenticator.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Authenticator, 1stF / First Factor</dt>
	<dd><p>A FIDO Authenticator that transactionally provides a username and at 
	  least two authentication factors: cryptographic key material (something you have) 
	  plus user verification (something you know / something you are) and so can be used by 
	  itself to complete an authentication.</p>
	  <p>It is assumed that these authenticators have an internal matcher. The matcher is 
	    able to verify an already enrolled user. If there is more than one user enrolled – the 
	    matcher is also able to identify the right user.</p>
	  <p>Examples of such authenticator is a biometric sensor or a PIN based verification. 
	    Authenticators which only verify presence, such as a physical button, or perform no 
	    verification at all, cannot act as a first-factor authenticator.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Authenticator, 2ndF / Second Factor</dt>
	<dd>A FIDO Authenticator which acts only as a second factor.  Second-factor authenticators always 
	  require a single key handle to be provided before responding to a <code>Sign</code> command.  
	  They might or might not have a user verification method.
	  It is assumed that these authenticators may or may not have an internal matcher.
	</dd>
	<dt>Authenticator Attestation</dt>
	<dd>The process of communicating a cryptographic assertion to a relying party 
	  that a key presented during authenticator registration was created and protected by a 
	  genuine authenticator with verified characteristics.
	</dd>
	<dt>Authenticator Metadata</dt>
	<dd><p>Verified information about the characteristics of a certified authenticator, associated

	<dt>AV</dt>
	<dd><p>ASM Version</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Bound Authenticator</dt>
	<dd><p>A FIDO Authenticator or combination of authenticator and ASM, which uses an access control 
	  mechanism to restrict the use of registered keys to trusted FIDO Clients and/or trusted 
	  FIDO User Devices. Compare to a <em>Roaming Authenticator</em>.</p>

	</dd>
	<dt>Channel Binding</dt>
	<dd><p>See: [[RFC5056]], [[RFC5929]] and [[ChannelID]].
	  A channel binding allows applications to establish that the two end-points

	<dt>Confused Deputy Problem</dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    A confused deputy is a computer program that is innocently

	</dd>
	<dt>Correlation Handle</dt>
	<dd><p>Any piece of information that may allow, in the context of FIDO protocols, implicit 
	  or explicit association and or attribution of multiple actions, believed by the user 
	  to be distinct and unrelated, back to a single unique entity.   An example of a 
	  correlation handle outside of the FIDO context is a client certificate used in 
	  traditional TLS mutual authentication: because it sends the same data to multiple 
	  Relying Parties, they can therefore collude to uniquely identify and track the user 
	  across unrelated activities. [[AnonTerminology]]</p>

	  the Relying Party.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Discovery</dt>

	<dt>Enrollment</dt>
	<dd><p>The process of making a user known to an authenticator.  This might be a 
	  biometric enrollment as defined in [[NSTCBiometrics]] or involve processes 
	  such as taking ownership of, and setting a PIN or password for, a non-biometric 
	  cryptographic storage device.  Enrollment may happen as part of a FIDO protocol 
	  ceremony, or it may happen outside of the FIDO context for multi-purpose authenticators.</p>

	</dd>
	<dt>FIDO Authenticator</dt>
	<dd><p>An authentication entity that meets the FIDO Alliance’s requirements 
	  and which has related metadata.</p>
	  <p>A FIDO Authenticator is responsible for user verification, and maintaining 
	    the cryptographic material required for the relying party authentication.</p>
	  <p>It is important to note that a FIDO Authenticator is only considered such for, 
	    and in relation to, its participation in FIDO Alliance protocols.  Because the 
	    FIDO Alliance aims to utilize a diversity of existing and future hardware, 
	    many devices used for FIDO may have other primary or secondary uses.  
	    To the extent that a device is used for non-FIDO purposes such as local 
	    operating system login or network login with non-FIDO protocols, it is not 
	    considered a FIDO Authenticator and its operation in such modes is <i>not</i> 
	    subject to FIDO Alliance guidelines or restrictions, including those related 
	    to security and privacy.</p>
	  <p>A FIDO Authenticator may be referred to as simply an authenticator 
	    or abbreviated as “authnr”.  Important distinctions in an authenticator’s 
	    capabilities and user experience may be experienced depending on whether 
	    it is a roaming or bound authenticator, and whether it is a first-factor, 
	    or second-factor authenticator.</p>
	  <p>It is assumed by registration assertion schemes that the authenticator has 
	    exclusive control over the data being signed by the attestation key.</p>
	  <p>Some authentication assertion schemes (e.g. TAG_UAFV1_AUTH_ASSERTION)  
	    assume the authenticator to have exclusive control over the data being 
	    signed by the <code>Uauth key</code>.</p>
	</dd>
	    <dt>FIDO Client</dt>
	    <dd><p>This is the software entity processing the UAF or U2F protocol 
	      messages on the FIDO User Device. FIDO Clients may take one of two forms:</p>
	      <ul>
	       <li>A software component implemented in a user agent 
		 (either web browser or native application).</li>
	       <li>A standalone piece of software shared by several user agents. 
		 (web browsers or native applications).</li>
	      </ul>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>FIDO Data / FIDO Information</dt>
	    <dd><p>Any information gathered or created as part of completing a FIDO transaction.  
	      This includes but is not limited to, biometric measurements of or reference data for 
	      the user and FIDO transaction history.</p>

	    <dt>FIDO Server</dt>
	    <dd><p>Server software typically deployed in the relying party’s

	    <dd><p>See FIDO Client.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>FIDO User Device</dt>
	    <dd><p>The computing device where the FIDO Client operates, and from 
	      which the user initiates an action that utilizes FIDO.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Key Identifier (KeyID)</dt>
	    <dd>
	      <p>The KeyID is an opaque identifier for a key
		registered by an authenticator with a FIDO Server, for
		first-factor authenticators. It is used in concert
		with an AAID to identify a particular authenticator
		that holds the necessary key. Thus key identifiers
		must be unique within the scope of an AAID.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		One possible implementation is that the KeyID is the SHA256 hash of the <code>KeyHandle</code>
		managed by the ASM.
	      </p>
	    </dd>

	    <dt>KeyHandle</dt>
	    <dd><p>A key container created by a FIDO Authenticator, containing a private key 
	      and (optionally) other data (such as Username).  A key handle may be wrapped 
	      (encrypted with a key known only to the authenticator) or unwrapped.  In the 
	      unwrapped form it is referred to as a <em>raw key handle</em>.  Second-factor authenticators must 
	      retrieve their key handles from the relying party to function. First-factor authenticators 
	      manage the storage of their own key handles, either internally 
	      (for roaming authenticators) or via the associated ASM (for bound authenticators).</p>
	    </dd>

	    <dt>Key Registration</dt>
	    <dd><p>The process of securely establishing a key between FIDO Server and FIDO Authenticator.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>KeyRegistrationData (KRD)</dt>
	    <dd><p>A <code>KeyRegistrationData</code> object is created and returned by an authenticator 
	      as the result of the authenticator's <code>Register</code> command. The KRD object contains 
	      items such as the authenticator's AAID, the newly generated UAuth.pub key, as 
	      well as other authenticator-specific information such as algorithms used by the 
	      authenticator for performing cryptographic operations, and counter values. The 
	      KRD object is signed using the authenticator's attestation private key.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>KHAccessToken</dt>
	    <dd><p>A secret value that acts as a guard for authenticator commands.  
	      KHAccessTokens are generated and provided by an ASM.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Matcher</dt>
	    <dd><p>A component of a FIDO Authenticator which is able to perform (local) 
	      user verification, e.g. biometric comparison [[ISOBiometrics]], PIN verification, etc.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Matcher Protections</dt>
	    <dd>
	      The security mechanisms that an authenticator may use to
	      protect the matcher component. 
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Persona</dt>
	    <dd><p>All relevant data stored in an authenticator 
	      (e.g. cryptographic keys) are related to a single "persona" (e.g. “business” or “personal” persona). 
	      Some administrative interface (not standardized by FIDO) provided by the authenticator 
	      may allow maintenance and switching of personas.</p>
	      <p>The user can switch to the “Personal” Persona and register new accounts. 
		After switching back to the “Business” Persona, these accounts will not be 
		recognized by the authenticator (until the User switches back to “Personal” Persona again).</p>
	      <p>This mechanism may be used to provide an additional
		measure of privacy to the user, where the user wishes to
		use the same authenticator in multiple contexts, without
		allowing correlation via the authenticator across those
		contexts.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>PersonaID</dt>
	    <dd><p>An identifier provided by an ASM, PersonaID is used to associate 
	      different registrations.  It can be used to create virtual identities on a 
	      single authenticator, for example to differentiate “personal” and “business” 
	      accounts.  PersonaIDs can be used to manage privacy settings on the authenticator.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Reference Data</dt>
	    <dd><p>A (biometric) reference data (also called template) is a digital reference 
	      of distinct characteristics that have been extracted from a biometric sample. 
	      Biometric reference data is used during the biometric user verification 
	      process [[ISOBiometrics]]. Non-biometric reference data is used
	      in conjunction with PIN-based user verification.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Registration</dt>
	    <dd><p>A FIDO protocol operation in which a user generates and associates new 
	      key material with an account at the Relying Party, subject to policy set 
	      by the server, and acceptable attestation that the authenticator and 
	      registration matches that policy.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Registration Scheme</dt>
	    <dd><p>The registration scheme defines how the authentication key is being 
	      exchanged between the FIDO Server and the FIDO Authenticator.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Relying Party</dt>
	    <dd><p>A web site or other entity that uses a FIDO protocol to directly

	      FIDO is composed with federated identity management protocols (e.g., SAML, 
	      OpenID Connect, etc.), the identity provider will also be playing the role

	    <dd><p>An authentication which is performed on top of an already authenticated session.</p>
	      <p>Example: The user authenticates the session initially

		requests a FIDO authentication on top of this
		authenticated session.</p>
	      <p>One reason for requesting step-up authenication could

	      <p>FIDO U2F is always used as a step-up authentication.
		FIDO UAF could be used as step-up authentication, but
		it could also be used as an initial authentication
		mechanism.</p>
	      <p>Note: In general, there is no implication that the
		step-up authentication method itself is "stronger"
		than the initial authentication.  Since the step-up
		authentication is performed on top of an existing
		authentication, the resulting combined authentication
		strength will increase most likely, but it will never
		decrease.</p>
