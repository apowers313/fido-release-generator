        <h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>Modern networked applications typically present several ways that a user can interact with them.  
	  This document introduces the concept of an <em>Application Facet</em> to describe the identities 
	  of a single logical application across various platforms. For example, the application MyBank may 
	  have an Android app, an iOS app, and a Web app accessible from a browser. These are all facets of 
	  the MyBank application.</p>

        <p>The FIDO architecture provides for simpler and stronger authentication than traditional username 
	  and password approaches while avoiding many of the shortfalls of alternative authentication 
	  schemes. At the core of the FIDO protocols are challenge and response operations performed with a 
	  public/private keypair that serves as a user's credential.</p>

        <p>To minimize frequently-encountered issues around privacy, entanglements with concepts of "identity", 
	  and the necessity for trusted third parties, keys in FIDO are tightly scoped and dynamically 
	  provisioned between the user and each Relying Party and only optionally associated with a 
	  server-assigned username. This approach contrasts with, for example, traditional PKIX client certificates 
	  as used in TLS, which introduce a trusted third party, mix in their implementation details identity 
	  assertions with holder-of-key cryptographic proofs, lack audience restrictions, and may even be sent 
	  in the cleartext portion of a protocol handshake without the user's notification or consent.</p>

        <p>While the FIDO approach is preferable for many reasons, it introduces several challenges.</p>
        <uL>
            <li>What set of Web origins and native applications (facets) make up a single logical application and how 
	      can they be reliably identified?</li>
            <li>How can we avoid making the user register a new key for each web browser or application on 
	      their device that accesses services controlled by the same target entity?</li>
            <li>How can access to registered keys be shared without violating the security guarantees around 
	      application isolation and protection from malicious code that users expect on their devices?</li>
            <li>How can a user roam credentials between multiple devices, each with a user-friendly 
	      Trusted Computing Base for FIDO?</li>
        </uL>

        <p>This document describes how FIDO addresses these goals (where adequate platform mechanisms 
	  exist for enforcement) by allowing an application to declare a credential scope that crosses 
	  all the various facets it presents to the user.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>FIDO conceptually sets a scope for registered keys to the tuple of (Username, Authenticator, Relying Party). 
	      But what constitutes a Relying Party? It is quite common for a user to access the 
	      same set of services from a Relying Party, on the same device, in one or more web 
	      browsers as well as one or more dedicated apps. As the Relying Party may require 
	      the user to perform a costly ceremony in order to prove her identity and register 
	      a new FIDO key, it is undesirable that the user should have to repeat this ceremony 
	      multiple times on the same device, once for each browser or app.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Avoiding App-Phishing</h3>

            <p>FIDO provides for user-friendly verification ceremonies to allow access to registered keys, 
	      such as entering a simple PIN code and touching a device, or scanning a finger. It should 
	      not matter for security purposes if the user re-uses the same verification inputs across 
	      Relying Parties, and in the case of a biometric, she may have no choice.</p>

            <p>Modern operating systems that use an "app store" distribution model often make a promise 
	      to the user that it is "safe to try" any app. They do this by providing strong isolation 
	      between applications, so that they may not read each others' data or mutually interfere, 
	      and by requiring explicit user permission to access shared system resources.</p>

            <p>If a user were to download a maliciously constructed game that instructs her to activate 
	      her FIDO authenticator in order to "save your progress" but actually unlocks her banking 
	      credential and takes over her account, FIDO has failed, because the risk of phishing has 
	      only been moved from the password to an app download. FIDO must not violate a platform's 
	      promise that any app is "safe to try" by keeping good custody of the high-value shared 
	      state that a registered key represents.</p>

        </section>


        <section>
            <h3>Comparison to OAuth and OAuth2</h3>
            <p>The OAuth and OAuth2 of protocols were designed for a server-to-server security model 
	      with the assumption that each application instance can be issued, and keep, an "application secret". 
	      This approach is ill-suited to the "app store" security model. Although it is common for services 
	      to provision an OAuth-style application secret into their apps in an attempt to allow only 
	      authorized/official apps to connect, any such "secret" is in fact shared among everyone 
	      with access to the app store and can be trivially recovered thorough basic reverse engineering.</p>

            <p>In contrast, FIDO's facet concept is designed for the "app store" model from the start. 
	      It relies on client-side platform isolation features to make sure that a key registered 
	      by a user with a member of a well-behaved "trusted club" stays within that trusted club, 
	      even if the user later installs a malicious app, and does not require any secrets hard-coded 
	      into a shared package to do so. The user must, however, still make good decisions about which 
	      apps and browsers they are willing to preform a registration ceremony with. App store policing 
	      can assist here by removing applications which solicit users to register FIDO keys to for Relying 
	      Parties in order to make illegitmate or fraudulent use of them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Non-Goals</h3>
            <p>The <em>Application Facet</em> concept does not attempt to strongly identify the calling 
	      application to a service across a network. Remote attestation of an application identity 
	      is an explicit non-goal.</p>

            <p>If an unauthorized app can convince a user to provide all the information to it required 
	      to register a new FIDO key, the Relying Party cannot use FIDO protocols or the Facet concept 
	      to recognize as unauthorized, or deny such an application from performing FIDO operations, 
	      and an application that a user has chosen to trust in such a manner can also share access 
	      to a key outside of the mechanisms described in this document.</p>

            <p>The facet mechanism provides a way for registered keys to maintain their proper scope when 
	      created and accessed from a <em>Trusted Computing Base</em> (TCB) that provides isolation of malicious 
	      apps. A user can also roam their credentials between multiple devices with user-friendly TCBs 
	      and credentials will retain their proper scope if this mechanism is correctly implemented by 
	      each. However, no guarantees can be made in environments where the TCB is user-hostile, such 
	      as a device with malicious code operating with "root" level permissions. On environments that
	      do not provide application isolation but run all code with the privileges of the user, (e.g. traditional 
	      desktop operating systems) an intact TCB, including web browsers, may successfully enforce 
	      scoping of credentials for web origins only, but cannot meaningfully enforce application scoping.</p>

    <section>
        <h5>The AppID and FacetID Assertions</h5>


        <p>When a user performs a Registration operation [[UAFArchOverview]] a new private key is created 
	  by their authenticator, and the public key is sent to the Relying Party. As part of this process, 
	  each key is associated with an <code>AppID</code>. The <code>AppID</code> is a URL carried as part 
	  of the protocol message sent by the server and indicates the target for this credential. By default, 
	  the audience of the credential is restricted to the <em>Same Origin</em> of the <code>AppID</code>. 
	  In some circumstances, a Relying Party may desire to apply a larger scope to a key. If 
	  that <code>AppID</code> URL has the <code>https</code> scheme, a FIDO client may be able to 
	  dereference and process it as a <code>TrustedFacetList</code> that designates a scope or audience 
	  restriction that includes multiple facets, such as other web origins within the same DNS zone of 
	  control of the AppID's origin, or URLs indicating the identity of other types of trusted facets 
	  such as mobile apps.</p>

        <p class='note'>Users may also register multiple keys on a single authenticator for an
            <code>AppID</code>, such as for cases where they have multiple accounts. Such registrations may 
	    have a Relying Party assigned username or local nicknames associated to allow them to be distinguished 
	    by the user, or they may not (e.g. for 2nd factor use cases, the user account associated with a key 
	    may be communicated out-of-band to what is specified by FIDO protocols).  All registrations 
	    that share an <code>AppID</code>, also share these same audience restriction.</p>

          <h3>Processing Rules for AppID and FacetID Assertions </h3>
	  
	  <section>
	    <h4>Determining the FacetID of a Calling Application</h4>
	    <p>In the Web case, the FacetID MUST be the Web Origin [[!RFC6454]] of the
	      web page triggering the FIDO operation, written as a URI with
	      an empty path. Default ports are omitted and any path component is ignored.</p>

	    <p>An example FacetID is shown below:</p>
	      
              <pre>https://login.mycorp.com/</pre>
	      
            <p>In the Android [[ANDROID]] case, the FacetID MUST be a URI derived from the SHA-1 hash
	      of the APK signing certificate [[APK-Signing]], such as:
	      
	      <pre>android:apk-key-hash:&lt;sha1_hash-of-apk-signing-cert&gt;</pre>
	      
 	    <p>The SHA-1 hash can be computed as follows:
	      
              <pre class="example" title="Computing an APK signing certificate hash">
# Export the signing certificate in DER format, hash, base64 encode and trim '='

keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore \
	&lt;path-to-apk-signing-keystore&gt; &amp;&gt;2 /dev/null | openssl sha1 \
	-binary | openssl base64 | sed 's/=//g'
              </pre>

	    <p>In the iOS [[iOS]] case, the FacetID MUST be the BundleID [[BundleID]] URI of the application:
	      
              <pre>ios:bundle-id:&lt;ios-bundle-id-of-app&gt;</pre>

	    <h4>Determining if a Caller's FacetID is Authorized for an AppID</h4>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>If the AppID is not an HTTPS URL, and matches the FacetID of the caller, 
		  no additional processing is necessary and the operation may proceed.</li>
                <li>If the AppID is null or empty, the client MUST set the AppID to be the FacetID 
		  of the caller, and the operation may proceed without additional processing.</li>
                <li>If the caller's FacetID is an <code>https://</code> Origin sharing the same host as the AppID, 
		  (e.g. if an application hosted at <code>https://fido.example.com/myApp</code> set 
		  an AppID of <code>https://fido.example.com/myAppId</code>), no additional processing 
		  is necessary and the operation may proceed.  This algorithm MAY be continued 
		  asynchronously for purposes of caching the Trusted Facet List, if desired.</li>
                <li>Begin to fetch the Trusted Facet List using the HTTP GET method.  
		  The location MUST be identified with an HTTPS URL.</li>

                <li>The URL MUST be dereferenced with an 
		  <a href='http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/fetching-resources.html#attr-crossorigin-anonymous'>anonymous 
		    fetch</a>. That is, the HTTP GET MUST include no cookies, authentication, 
		  Origin or Referer headers, and present no TLS certificates or other forms of credentials.
                </li>
                <li>The response MUST set a MIME Content-Type of "application/fido.trusted-apps+json".</li>
                <li>The caching related HTTP header fields in the HTTP response (e.g. “Expires”) SHOULD be 
		  respected when fetching a Trusted Facets List.</li>
                <li>The server hosting the Trusted Facets List MUST respond uniformly to all clients. 
		  That is, it MUST NOT vary the contents of the response body based on any credential 
		  material, including ambient authority such as originating IP address, supplied with the request.</li>
                <li>If the server returns an HTTP redirect (status code 3xx) the server MUST also send 
		  the HTTP header <code>FIDO-AppID-Redirect-Authorized: true</code> and the client MUST verify the presence 
		  of such a header before following the redirect. This protects against abuse of open 
		  redirectors within the target domain by unauthorized parties. If this check has passed, 
		  restart this algorithm from step 4.</li>
                <li>A Trusted Facet List MAY contain an unlimited number of entries, but clients MAY truncate 
		  or decline to process large responses.</li>
		<li>From among the objects in the <code>trustedFacet</code> array, select the one with 
		  the <code>version</code> matching that of the protocol message version.</li>
                <li>The scheme of URLs in <code>ids</code> MUST identify either an application 
		  identity (e.g. using the <code>apk:</code>, <code>ios:</code> or similar scheme) or an <code>https:</code> Web Origin [[RFC6454]].</li>
                <li>Entries in <code>ids</code> using the <code>https://</code> scheme MUST contain only scheme, 
		  host and port components, with an optional trailing /. Any path, query string, username/password, 
		  or fragment information MUST be discarded.</li>
                <li>All Web Origins listed MUST have host names under the scope of the same least-specific 
		  private label in the DNS, using the following algorithm:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Obtain the list of public DNS suffixes 
		      from <a href='https://publicsuffix.org/list/effective_tld_names.dat'>https://publicsuffix.org/list/effective_tld_names.dat</a> 
		      (the client MAY cache such data), or equivalent functionality as available on the platform.</li>
                    <li>Extract the host portion of the original AppID URL, before following any redirects.</li>
                    <li>The least-specific private label is the portion of the host portion of the AppID URL that 
		      matches a public suffix plus one additional label to the left.</li>
                    <li>For each Web Origin in the TrustedFacets list, the calculation of the least-specific 
		      private label in the DNS MUST be a case-insensitive match of that of the AppID URL itself. 
		      Entries that do not match MUST be discarded.</li>
                  </ol>
		</li>
                <li>If the TrustedFacets list cannot be retrieved and successfully parsed according to 
		  these rules, the client MUST abort processing of the requested FIDO operation.</li>
		<li>After processing the <code>trustedFacets</code> entry of the correct 
		  <code>version</code> and removing any invalid entries, if the
		  caller's FacetID matches one listed in <code>ids</code>, the operation is allowed.</li>

              <h4>Obtaining FacetID of Android Native App</h4>
              The following code demonstrates how a FIDO Client can obtain and construct
              the FacetID of a calling Android native application.
	      
              <pre>
                <div class='example' title="AndroidFacetID">
private String getFacetID(Context aContext, int callingUid) {

    String packageNames[] = aContext.getPackageManager().getPackagesForUid(callingUid);

    if (packageNames == null) {
        return null;
    }

    try {
        PackageInfo info = aContext.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(packageNames[0], PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);

        byte[] cert = info.signatures[0].toByteArray();
        InputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(cert);

        CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X509");
        X509Certificate c = (X509Certificate) cf.generateCertificate(input);

        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA1");

        return "android:apk-key-hash:" +
                  Base64.encodeToString(md.digest(c.getEncoded()), Base64.DEFAULT | Base64.NO_WRAP | Base64.NO_PADDING);

        e.printStackTrace();
    }

        e.printStackTrace();

    catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();

    catch (CertificateEncodingException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

              <h4>Additional Security Considerations</h4> 
              
              <p>The UAF protocol supports passing FacetID to the FIDO Server and 
		including the FacetID in the computation of the authentication response.</p>
                
                <p>Trusting a web origin facet implicitly trusts all subdomains under the named entity 
		  because web user agents do not provide a security barrier between such origins. So, 
		  in AppID Example 1, although not explicitly listed, "https://foobar.register.example.com" 
		  would still have effective access to credentials registered for the AppID "https://www.example.com/appID" 
		  because it can effectively act as "https://register.example.com".</p>

              <p>The component implementing the controls described here must reliably identify 
		callers to securely enforce the mechanisms.  Platform inter-process communication 
		mechanisms which allow such identification SHOULD be
		used when available.</p>
                
              <p>It is unlikely that the component implementing the controls described here can verify
                the integrity and intent of the entries on a <code>TrustedFacetList</code>.  If a trusted
                facet can be compromised or enlisted as a <em>confused deputy</em> [[FIDOGlossary]] by a malicious party, it may
                be possible to trick a user into completing an authentication ceremony under the control
                of that malicious party.</p>
	      

	      <section class='informative'>
		<h5>Wildcards in TrustedFacet identifiers</h5>
		<p>Wildcards are not supported in TrustedFacet identifiers.  This follows the advice of
		  RFC6125 [[!RFC6125]], section 7.2.</p>
		<p>FacetIDs are URIs that uniquely identify specific 
		  security principals that are trusted to interact with a given registered credential. Wildcards introduce
		  undesirable ambiguitiy in the defintion of the principal,
		  as there is no consensus syntax for what wildcards mean, how they
		  are expanded and where they can occur across different applications and protocols in common use.
		  For schemes indicating application identities,
		  it is not clear that wildcarding is appropriate in any fashion.  For Web Origins, it broadly increases
		  the scope of the credential to potentially include rogue or buggy hosts.</p>
		<p>Taken together, these ambiguities might introduce exploitable differences in
      		  identity checking behavior among client implementations and would
      		  necessitate overly complex and inefficient identity checking algorithms.</p>
